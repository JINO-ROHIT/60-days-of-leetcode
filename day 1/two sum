class Solution(object):
    def twoSum(self, nums, target):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :type target: int
        :rtype: List[int]
        """
        map = {}
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            t1 = target - nums[i]
            if t1 not in map:
                map[nums[i]] = i
            elif t1 in map:
                return [map[t1], i]


Approach - since we are required to return the indexes of both the elements, ive used  a typical hashing technique

1. Loop through the elements
2. Subtract each element from the target and if the subtracted value is present , we return the index
3. use a dictionary to store the elements and the indexes of the array.
