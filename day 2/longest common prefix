    def longestCommonPrefix(self, strs):
        """
        :type strs: List[str]
        :rtype: str
        """
        result = ""
        total_lengths = [len(ele) for ele in strs]
        length_to_check_upto = min(total_lengths)
        
        for i in range(0, length_to_check_upto + 1):
            sample_ref = strs[0][:i]
            for ele in strs:
                if ele[:i] != sample_ref:
                    return result
            result = sample_ref
        return result

1. take the min length among the elements so that you know where the longest prefix can possibly end
2. take the first element(or any element) as a reference and run a loop from position 0 and check for each element iteratively.
3. if the condition fails return ""
