class Solution(object):
    def lengthOfLastWord(self, s):
        """
        :type s: str
        :rtype: int
        """
        l = list(s.split(' '))
        idx = -1
        while len(l[idx]) == 0:
            idx -= 1
        return len(l[idx])


the trick here is since we have a lot of white space tokens, we start iterating from the end and only when we find a word with len > 0, we return
the length of the word
